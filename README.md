Crossy Squirrel is a fun, interactive game where the player controls a squirrel that needs to cross multiple lanes filled with dangers such as speeding wolves and flowing rivers. 
Players navigate using arrow keys, dodge obstacles, and hop onto boats to cross treacherous waters. Acorns randomly appear, granting power-ups that either help or challenge the player.

Cool Features of the Code

Dynamic Layer System:
The game is divided into multiple color-coded layers representing grass, roads, and water.
Each layer can spawn obstacles, such as boats or wolves, depending on random generation.

Obstacle Spawning:
Boats and wolves move across the screen with randomized directions and speeds.
Players must time their movements carefully to avoid collisions.

Player-Boat Interaction:
If the player lands on a boat, the squirrel moves along with the boa.

Randomized Power-Ups:
Collecting an acorn grants a random power-up:
Speed Boost: Increases the player’s speed for a short time.
Slow Down: Reduces the player’s speed, making navigation harder.
Fast Obstacles: Increases the speed of all obstacles, adding a challenging twist.
Scoring System:

Players earn points for successfully advancing layers without dying.
Acorns collected multiply the score at the end.
Game Reset and Replay:

Hitting Enter starts or restarts the game.
Collision detection with water or wolves ends the game.

Gradual Difficulty Increase:
As the player progresses, grass layers decrease and more road and water segments spawn.
